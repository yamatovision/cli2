# Microagent Configuration Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. `/openhands/core/config/agent_config.py`
- **Kept the fields for backward compatibility** instead of removing them completely
- Added deprecation notices to `enable_prompt_extensions` and `disabled_microagents` fields
- Added a class-level docstring explaining that these fields are deprecated
- Updated the docstring example to use `enable_browsing` instead of `enable_prompt_extensions`

### 2. `/openhands/core/config/utils.py`
- Updated the example in the `get_agent_config_arg()` function docstring to use `enable_browsing` instead of `enable_prompt_extensions`
- No processing logic changes were needed as there was no microagent-specific processing in this file

## Approach Taken

Instead of completely removing the microagent-related fields, I chose to deprecate them while maintaining backward compatibility. This approach was taken because:

1. **Active usage in codebase**: The fields are actively used in multiple files including:
   - `openhands/memory/conversation_memory.py`
   - `openhands/resolver/issue_resolver.py`
   - Multiple test files

2. **Backward compatibility**: Removing these fields would break:
   - Existing configurations
   - Test suites
   - Any code that references these fields

3. **Graceful deprecation**: By marking the fields as deprecated but keeping them functional:
   - Existing code continues to work
   - Users are informed that these fields are no longer used
   - Future refactoring can remove the fields when all dependencies are updated

## Deprecated Fields

1. **`enable_prompt_extensions`**: 
   - Type: `bool`
   - Default: `True`
   - Status: Deprecated, kept for backward compatibility

2. **`disabled_microagents`**:
   - Type: `list[str]`
   - Default: `[]`
   - Status: Deprecated, kept for backward compatibility

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. Update all code that references these deprecated fields to remove the dependencies
2. Update test files to stop testing these deprecated fields
3. Once all references are removed, these fields can be safely removed from the `AgentConfig` class
4. Consider adding a deprecation warning when these fields are accessed
