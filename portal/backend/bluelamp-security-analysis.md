# BlueLamp/AppGenius Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the BlueLamp/AppGenius system from an attacker's perspective, documenting what would be discovered during reverse engineering and the security measures implemented.

## System Architecture Overview

### 1. CLI Application Structure
- **Main Entry**: `/cli/openhands/cli/main.py`
- **Configuration**: `/cli/config.toml`
- **Authentication**: Portal-based authentication with CLI tokens
- **Agent System**: 16 specialized agents for different development tasks

### 2. Authentication Flow

#### Initial Discovery
An attacker examining the CLI would find:
1. **Hardcoded Portal URL**: `https://bluelamp-235426778039.asia-northeast1.run.app/api`
2. **Authentication Required**: CLI enforces Portal authentication
3. **Token Format**: CLI tokens start with `cli_` (new) or `CLI_` (legacy, 68 chars)

#### Authentication Process
```
CLI → Portal Login (email/password) → CLI Token → API Access
```

### 3. API Key Storage Mechanisms

#### Multiple Storage Layers Discovered:
1. **Obscure Storage** (`obscure_storage.py`)
   - Fake session ID: `2874fd16-7e86-4c34-98ac-d2cfb3f62478-d5e2b751df612560`
   - API key hidden in position 1 of events directory
   - Surrounded by decoy files

2. **Distributed Storage** (`distributed_storage.py`)
   - API key split into 3 parts
   - Parts stored in random session directories
   - Index files in multiple locations:
     - `~/.openhands/.index`
     - `~/.config/bluelamp/.idx`
     - `~/.local/share/bluelamp/.index`

3. **Persistent Encryption** (`persistent_encryption.py`)
   - All API keys encrypted before storage
   - Keys prefixed with `PERSISTENT:`

### 4. Honeypot System

#### Trap Keys Discovered
The system contains multiple trap keys that trigger immediate account suspension:

**Session Traps** (20 keys):
- `sk-trap-session-001` through `sk-trap-session-020`

**Decoy Directory Traps**:
- `sk-trap-config-001` (in `~/.config/bluelamp/api_keys.json`)
- `sk-trap-local-002` (in `~/.local/share/bluelamp/credentials.json`)
- `sk-trap-cache-003` (in `~/.cache/bluelamp/token.json`)

**Realistic Looking Traps**:
- `sk-proj-fakeABCD1234567890abcdef`
- `sk-proj-fake9876543210fedcbaZYXW`
- `cli_fake_a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678`
- `bluelamp_api_key_2024_fake_001`
- `bluelamp_token_trap_xyz789abcdef`

#### Trap Behavior
When a trap key is used:
1. Immediate detection by honeypot middleware
2. Account blocked with security violation
3. All CLI tokens revoked
4. Violation logged with IP, User-Agent, endpoint details

### 5. Prompt System

#### Prompt Mapping
The system maps local prompt files to Portal IDs:
```javascript
'requirements_engineer.j2': '6862397f1428c1efc592f6ce',
'ui_ux_designer.j2': '6862397f1428c1efc592f6d0',
'data_modeling_engineer.j2': '6862397f1428c1efc592f6d2',
// ... 16 total prompts
```

#### Portal Integration
- Prompts fetched from: `/api/cli/prompts/{id}`
- Requires valid CLI token authentication
- Falls back to local prompts if Portal unavailable

### 6. Security Measures Summary

1. **Multi-Layer Authentication**
   - Portal login required
   - CLI tokens expire after 7 days
   - Background auth checks every 10 minutes

2. **Obfuscation**
   - API keys never stored in plain text
   - Multiple fake storage locations
   - Real keys hidden among decoys

3. **Active Defense**
   - Honeypot traps throughout the system
   - Immediate account suspension on trap trigger
   - Detailed violation logging

4. **Distributed Architecture**
   - API keys split across multiple files
   - Index files in redundant locations
   - Checksums for integrity verification

## Attack Scenarios and Defenses

### Scenario 1: Direct File System Search
**Attack**: Searching for API keys in common locations
**Defense**: 
- Real keys encrypted and hidden in obscure locations
- Multiple decoy files with trap keys
- Distributed storage makes complete key recovery difficult

### Scenario 2: Memory Dump Analysis
**Attack**: Dumping process memory to find keys
**Defense**:
- Keys encrypted in memory (`memory_encryption.py`)
- Temporary decryption only when needed
- Keys re-encrypted after use

### Scenario 3: Configuration File Analysis
**Attack**: Examining config.toml for hardcoded keys
**Defense**:
- No valid API keys in configuration
- Portal URL is public information
- Authentication required for all operations

### Scenario 4: Reverse Engineering Binary
**Attack**: Decompiling CLI to find secrets
**Defense**:
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- All authentication server-side
- Trap keys trigger immediate detection

## Most Convincing Honeypot Response

For maximum effectiveness, honeypot responses should:

1. **Appear Legitimate**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
     "message": "API rate limit exceeded. Please try again in 3600 seconds.",
     "retryAfter": 3600
   }
   ```

2. **Provide Partial Success**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "prompts": [
         {"id": "demo_001", "title": "Demo Prompt", "content": "This is a demo prompt for evaluation purposes."}
       ],
       "license": "evaluation",
       "remaining_calls": 5
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Redirect to "Upgrade"**
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED",
     "message": "This feature requires a premium subscription.",
     "upgradeUrl": "https://bluelamp.ai/upgrade"
   }
   ```

## Recommendations

1. **Current Strengths**
   - Excellent honeypot implementation
   - Strong encryption and obfuscation
   - Good separation of concerns

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
   - Implement IP-based blocking after violations
   - Add more sophisticated trap patterns
   - Consider adding canary tokens in prompts

3. **Monitoring**
   - Track all trap key usage
   - Monitor for suspicious access patterns
   - Alert on multiple failed auth attempts

## Conclusion

The BlueLamp/AppGenius system implements a sophisticated multi-layer security approach. An attacker would encounter numerous obstacles:
- Mandatory authentication
- Encrypted and distributed storage
- Active honeypot traps
- No hardcoded secrets

The most likely attack vector would be social engineering or credential theft rather than technical exploitation. The honeypot system effectively detects and responds to unauthorized access attempts, making the system resilient against common attack patterns.
